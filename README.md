# Tech Confs Africa

TechConfsAfrica is a web-based tool designed to serve as a comprehensive repository of tech events in Africa. Its primary goal is to provide users with a centralized platform to easily discover and access information about various tech-related conferences, seminars, workshops, and other technology-focused events across Africa.

## Creating a branch

Creating a branch should follow the following pattern:

* New branches should only be created off the `develop` branch

* New branches should follow the naming convention
`[TCA-TaskID]/add-navbar-header`
* Commits should follow the [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern along with the ID of the task e.g `[TCA-25]feat: add responsiveness to header for mobile screens`

* All changes should be merged to `develop` branch ia a pull request explaining what the changes entails.
